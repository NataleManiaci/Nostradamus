2019-05-09,"(and sorry for spamming your Twitter feed)(and you can read our whole impact report here: )Basically: As deployment of Tesla’s products continues to accelerate, we can scale the adoption of renewable energy, cost-effectively modernize our aging infrastructure (and become less reliant on it) and improve the resilience of the electric grid to benefit everyone.Clean energy will be stored in 🔋giant batteries🔋 to make the entire grid more efficient, sustainable, and resilient: Homeowners can install solar panels or Solar Roof to power their home using 100% renewable energy and store that energy in Powerwall.
 
As part of Master Plan, Part Deux, we introduced Tesla Semi, an all-electric truck that delivers massive savings in energy costs, performance, efficiency and reliability.

We designed the world’s first-ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up, Model S, our Model X SUV, and an affordable vehicle for the mass market, Model 3.(Elon also sent one up to Space, but that's not technically in the Master Plan) 🚗 🚀The first step in our Master Plan was to build an electric sports car (the Tesla Roadster) to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive all-electric.

We are focused on creating a complete power and transportation ecosystem from solar generation and energy storage to electric vehicles. 

Vehicles can be entirely powered by clean energy from our most abundant resource: the sun 🌞We recognize that we cannot achieve our mission alone, so we decided to open source Tesla patents, making them accessible to anyone who wants to design and build electric vehicles. 

And the world cannot address its energy habits without directly reducing emissions in the transportation and power sectors. 

This issue is Tesla’s entire reason for existing.Annual CO2 emissions have approximately doubled over the past 50 years to over 35 gigatons per year. The path that the world currently is on is unsustainable and unwise. 

The world cannot reduce CO2 emissions without addressing energy generation and consumption.Climate change is reaching alarming levels – in large part due to emissions from burning fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation.Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
